# Family-Annihilation-Database
## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive database to analyze family annihilation cases in the United States from 2013 to 2025. Using data sourced from the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/), the primary objective is to address the absence of a centralized resource that provides insights into the characteristics and prevalence of this specific crime. The project utilizes MySQL and MySQL Workbench for data management and analysis.

## Background

Family annihilation, or familicide, is a type of murder or murder-suicide in which an individual or group of individuals kill multiple family members in succession, often including children, spouses, siblings, or parents. In most of these cases, the killer(s) ultimately commits suicide. This database seeks to categorize such incidents to provide deeper insights into these tragic events.

## Technologies Used

MySQL: For database creation, storage, and query execution.
MySQL Workbench: As the graphical interface for database management and development.
